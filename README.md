# Advent of Code 2021

Following along the daily challenges until 25th of Dec 2021.

Link to challenge: [AdventOfCode.com](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Requirements

1. Recent NodeJS installation.
2. ts-node package installed globally.

## Challenge Input Data

Each user will get the same challenge as all other users but the data used in the challenge
for computing the solution is different for each user.

You need to register in the challenge to get your own input data in order for the code to run.

## Run

You can run the code for solving the challenge by following these steps:

1. Place the data provided to you by the challenge in `data/day#.txt` where `#` is the day number (make sure the `End-of-Line` character is `LF` and _not_ `CRLF` or `CR`).
2. Run the script for that day using the command `ts-node day#.js` where `#` is the day number.
3. You will get a two lines of output. The first line is the solution for part 1, the second line for part 2.
